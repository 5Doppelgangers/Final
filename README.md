## Introduction

Our team name is 5Doppelgangers and our selected topic is "Where it pays to go to college?" where we will look at entry level and mid tier salary by percentiles for states within the US based on the college attended. Our data comes from Kaggle, as Kaggle is a trustworthy site with a lot of interesting datasets that was recommended by our TA. Our data comes in the form of CSV files pulled directly from the Kaggle website. Questions that we hope to answer with the data include, but are not limited to, the following: 

1. Which school had the highest paid graduates? Can we predict, based on school, what a person's salary will likely be regardless of major?
2. Which state within the US pays the highest salaries to graduates from each school? Can we predict, based on a person's school and region, what they will likely make upon graduation? 

## Communication Protocol 

Our team will utilize Slack as the main form of communication. For emergencies, or in case of Slack malfunctioning, team members will text each other via cell phone or can connect via Linkedin messaging/email.
