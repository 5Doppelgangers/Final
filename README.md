## Introduction

Our team name is 5Doppelgangers and our selected topic is "Where it pays to go to college?" where we will look at entry level and mid tier salary by percentiles for states within the US based on the college attended. Our data comes from Kaggle, as Kaggle is a trustworthy site with a lot of interesting datasets that was recommended by our TA. Our data comes in the form of CSV files pulled directly from the Kaggle website. Questions that we hope to answer with the data include, but are not limited to, the following: 

1. Which school had the highest paid graduates? Can we predict, based on school, what a person's salary will likely be regardless of major?
2. Which state within the US pays the highest salaries to graduates from each school? Can we predict, based on a person's school and region, what they will likely make upon graduation?

## Data Exploration

### Analysis of College Data by U.S. Region

### Visualizations of categorical features
We visualized each categorical feature to see which features could be good predictors of salary.  We used a violin plot to see the shape of the distribution curve along with mean and interquartile ranges.

![Violin Plot - Region vs Salary](https://github.com/5Doppelgangers/Final/blob/main/Images/Violin%20Graph%20-%20Region%20vs%20Salaries.PNG)
We can see that the California region had the highest salary, followed closely by the Northeastern region. Distributions appear normal.

### Preliminary Data Preprocessing
- In the preliminary data preprocessing we removed the dollar signs and commas from our salary values.  We also removed all columns from the data set that we werenâ€™t using.
### Preliminary Feature Engineering & Preliminary Feature Selection
- We kept our features data (School Type) and target (Starting Median Salary), as our hypothesis was that we could predict starting salary based on school type.
- Our feature data was categorical, which we changed using OneHotEncoder
### Training and testing sets
- We split our data into training and testing sets using test_train_split from sklearn
- After splitting our data we scaled both training and testing data sets
### The Model
We chose to use a linear regression model as it designed to try and predict a value, in this case, starting salary.  Some limitations of linear regression models are:
 - Linear Regression is Limited to Linear Relationships
      - It assumes there is a straight-line relationship between dependent and independent variables, sometimes this is incorrect
 - Looks only at the Mean of the Dependent Variable
      - Not a complete description of relationships among variables

## Analysis

For our linear regression model we will be calculating the Mean Square Error (MSE).  The MSE is based on the square of the error and the value lies between 0 and infinity.  MSE is used to check how close estimates or forecasts are to actual values. Lower the MSE, the closer is forecast to actual. This is used as a model evaluation measure for regression models and the lower value indicates a better fit.  The smaller the MSE the more accurate the mdoel.

The MSE on the school Type only was 20,236,173.  The MSE on the School Type & Region was 18,556,8339.
